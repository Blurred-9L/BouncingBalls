# BOUNCING BALLS

### An Arkanoid clone for the heck of it

BouncingBalls will be a simple and, probably full of bugs, Arkanoid / Breakout clone.
If you do not remember such a game, the gameplay it is basically like top-down pong,
except there is no opponent; instead, the objective of the game is to clear a given
formation of bricks with a little ball which you must keep from falling out of the
screen.

The original game had a lot of levels, powerups and floating enemies which only served
the purpose of making the game harder. I probably will not have any of that any time
soon, however, I might consider adding it in the future.

A little disclaimer here: I am no sprite artist or equivalent, so the sprites used
are probably lacking in quality and even though I am practically cloning a game
(which has been copied countless times as well), I am not entirely comfortable with
using sprites that are ripped from the game or something like that. This project
is made entirely for education purposes and also because I feel like it, it might
even stop updating before it is finished.

##### Current status:

<strong>Done:</strong>
- Make the ball bounce on the walls.
- Add the bar and bar movement.
- Make the ball bounce on the bar properly <em>(Buggy as hell...)</em>.

<strong>To do:</strong>
- Add a simple brick layout.
- Make the ball bounce on bricks properly.
- Remove bricks when ball bounces on them.
- Add sounds whenever the ball bounces on certain objects (bricks and bar).
- Make the game stop whenever the ball falls off of the screen.
- Add lives to the game.
- Add a level loader and several default levels.
- Add music, even if crappy prop music is used.

<strong>Extra stuff that might not get done:</strong>
- Add powerups.
- Add floating enemies.
